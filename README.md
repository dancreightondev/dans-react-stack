# Dan's React Stack

A lightweight template containing everything I typically use in my React projects, including:

-   React (TypeScript)
-   Vite
-   Tailwind

## Setup

First, degit the repository:
`npx degit https://github.com/dancreightondev/dans-react-stack project-name`

Secondly, install the node modules:
`npm i`

Lastly, run the project using one of:
`npm run dev`
`npm run localhost`
`npm run network`
